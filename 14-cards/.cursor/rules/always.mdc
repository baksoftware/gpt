# Guidelines
- Don't start the dev server, I will test it myself, just say its ready for me to test
- There are two players which are controlled by the same user

# Primarily look in these files
- [main.ts](mdc:src/main.ts) contains the application setup code
- [HumanPlayer.ts](mdc:src/players/HumanPlayer.ts) is the code that controls what a player do
- [gameEngine.ts](mdc:src/gameEngine.ts) is the game engine
- [gamecards.json](mdc:public/berlin1920/gamecards.json) defines which specific cards are in this card set
