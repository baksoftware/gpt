Chatgpt prompt (o3):

I want to create a realistic simulation of a product development team, how it operates and produce software, how it makes rapid interactions with customers (who has a need). It should use LLMs to make a realistic simulation. Please help me lay out a description of such a simulation (I can code, treat me as an expert). 

and then to correct the result:

The purpose should be for a leader outside the team to learn about how it works. See various 'what if' scenarios play out. I'm not sure I need to simulate each of the people on the team in that detail you are describing. Could it make sense to make a simulation at a little higher granularity level. I.e. imagining the customer have needs and 10 features can solve that, but it needs to be tested, and the designer, product manager, and tech lead comes up with those features and need to test them, and the developers need to implement them. The variations 'what if' scenarios could be typically hard to grasp principles of product development.


Result was the prd.md

please implement the basic parts of what is written in @prd.md.
