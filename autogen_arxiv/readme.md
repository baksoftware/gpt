Its easier if you prepare a docker image which has the needed python packages installed already.
So download docker desktop, and generate the image from the Dockerfile. See how inside the file.

Test it by running the manual code for getting the papers, see how inside find_arxiv_manual.py

On your own system you need to install this:
````
$ pip3 install docker pyautogen
````
