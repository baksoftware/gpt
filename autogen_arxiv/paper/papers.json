[{"title": "Higher Dimensional Chain Conditions", "abstract": "We investigate higher dimensional chain conditions, where the largeness\nnotion is given by Fubini products of a given ideal. From strong saturation\nproperties of an ideal, we derive abstractly versions of higher dimensional\n$\\Delta$-system lemma, which imply many posets, including any finite support\niteration of $\\sigma$-centered posets and measure algebras, satisfy the higher\ndimensional chain conditions. We then show that if a poset satisfies a\nstrengthening of the $\\sigma$-finite chain condition by Horn and Tarski, then\nit satisfies higher dimensional chain conditions. As an application, we derive\nRamsey-theoretic consequences, namely various partition hypotheses as studied\nby Bannister, Bergfalk, Moore and Todorcevic, from the existence of ideals\nsatisfying strong chain conditions.", "authors": ["Stevo Todorcevic", "Jing Zhang"], "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11369v1"}, {"title": "Cyclic Proofs for iGL via Corecursion", "abstract": "Daniyar Shamkanov proved that three distinct systems of sequent calculi for\nGL are equivalent.
