## Higher Dimensional Chain Conditions

**Authors:** Stevo Todorcevic, Jing Zhang

We investigate higher dimensional chain conditions, where the largeness
notion is given by Fubini products of a given ideal. From strong saturation
properties of an ideal, we derive abstractly versions of higher dimensional
$\Delta$-system lemma, which imply many posets, including any finite support
iteration of $\sigma$-centered posets and measure algebras, satisfy the higher
dimensional chain conditions. We then show that if a poset satisfies a
strengthening of the $\sigma$-finite chain condition by Horn and Tarski, then
it satisfies higher dimensional chain conditions. As an application, we derive
Ramsey-theoretic consequences, namely various partition hypotheses as studied
by Bannister, Bergfalk, Moore and Todorcevic, from the existence of ideals
satisfying strong chain conditions.

## Cyclic Proofs for iGL via Corecursion

**Authors:** Borja Sierra-Miranda

Daniyar Shamkanov proved that three distinct systems of sequent calculi for
GL are equivalent. These systems consist in one with finite proofs, another
with ill-founded proofs and the last one with cyclic proofs. The main tool used
for proving the equivalence is corecursion. In this project, we prove the
equivalence between a finitary sequent calculus for iGL and a cyclic calculus,
using also coinductive methods.

## Implicative models of set theory

**Authors:** Samuele Maschio, Alexandre Miquel

In this paper we show that using implicative algebras one can produce models
of set theory generalizing Heyting/Boolean-valued models and realizability
models of (I)ZF, both in intuitionistic and classical logic. This has as
consequence that any topos which is obtained from a Set-based tripos as the
result of the tripos-to-topos construction hosts a model of intuitionistic or
classical set theory, provided a large enough strongly inaccessible cardinal
exists.
