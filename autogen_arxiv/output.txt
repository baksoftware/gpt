find the latest 3 LLM papers from arxiv, and make a markdown file with the title, abstract, and authors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner (to chat_manager):

Plan:

1. Engineer: Write a script to scrape the latest 3 LLM (Logic, Language, and Mathematics) papers from arxiv. The script should extract the title, abstract, and authors of each paper.

2. Engineer: Run the script and store the extracted information in a structured format, such as a JSON file.

3. Engineer: Write a script to convert the JSON file into a markdown file. The markdown file should contain the title, abstract, and authors of each paper.

4. Engineer: Run the script to generate the markdown file.

5. Scientist: Review the markdown file to ensure the information is accurate and complete.

6. Scientist: Provide feedback to the engineer if any revisions are needed.

7. Engineer: Make any necessary revisions based on the scientist's feedback.

8. Scientist: Approve the final markdown file.

9. Engineer: Submit the final markdown file to the admin for approval.

10. Admin: Review and approve the final markdown file. If any changes are needed, provide feedback to the engineer and scientist.

11. Repeat steps 7-10 until the admin approves the final markdown file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critic (to chat_manager):

The plan is generally sound, but it lacks a step for verifying the information. It's important to ensure that the information scraped from arxiv is accurate and up-to-date. Here's a revised plan:

1. Engineer: Write a script to scrape the latest 3 LLM (Logic, Language, and Mathematics) papers from arxiv. The script should extract the title, abstract, and authors of each paper.

2. Engineer: Run the script and store the extracted information in a structured format, such as a JSON file.

3. Engineer: Write a script to convert the JSON file into a markdown file. The markdown file should contain the title, abstract, authors, and source URL of each paper.

4. Engineer: Run the script to generate the markdown file.

5. Scientist: Review the markdown file to ensure the information is accurate and complete. Cross-check the information with the source URL.

6. Scientist: Provide feedback to the engineer if any revisions are needed.

7. Engineer: Make any necessary revisions based on the scientist's feedback.

8. Scientist: Approve the final markdown file.

9. Engineer: Submit the final markdown file to the admin for approval.

10. Admin: Review and approve the final markdown file. If any changes are needed, provide feedback to the engineer and scientist.

11. Repeat steps 7-10 until the admin approves the final markdown file.

This plan ensures that the information is verified against the source URL, which adds an extra layer of accuracy and reliability.

Engineer (to chat_manager):

Let's start by writing a Python script to scrape the latest 3 LLM (Logic, Language, and Mathematics) papers from arxiv. We will use the `arxiv` Python library to interact with the arXiv API. The script will extract the title, abstract, authors, and source URL of each paper and store this information in a JSON file.

```python
import arxiv
import json

# Search for the latest 3 LLM papers
search = arxiv.Search(
  query = "cat:math.LO",
  max_results = 3,
  sort_by = arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate
)

papers = []
for result in search.get():
  paper = {
    'title': result.title,
    'abstract': result.summary,
    'authors': [author.name for author in result.authors],
    'url': result.entry_id
  }
  papers.append(paper)

# Save the papers to a JSON file
with open('papers.json', 'w') as f:
  json.dump(papers, f)
```

This script will create a JSON file named `papers.json` containing the information of the latest 3 LLM papers. The next step is to convert this JSON file into a markdown file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to chat_manager):

I apologize for the mistake. The `arxiv` library's `Search` object doesn't have a `get` method. Instead, we should iterate over the `Search` object directly to get the results. Let's correct the script:

```python
import arxiv
import json

# Search for the latest 3 LLM papers
search = arxiv.Search(
  query = "cat:math.LO",
  max_results = 3,
  sort_by = arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate
)

papers = []
for result in search.results():
  paper = {
    'title': result.title,
    'abstract': result.summary,
    'authors': [author.name for author in result.authors],
    'url': result.entry_id
  }
  papers.append(paper)

# Save the papers to a JSON file
with open('papers.json', 'w') as f:
  json.dump(papers, f)
```

This script should correctly create a JSON file named `papers.json` containing the information of the latest 3 LLM papers.

  for result in search.results():


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to chat_manager):

I apologize for the confusion. The `results` method of the `Search` object is deprecated. We should use the `results` method of the `Client` object instead. Let's correct the script:

```python
import arxiv
import json

# Create a client
client = arxiv.Client()

# Search for the latest 3 LLM papers
search = arxiv.Search(
  query = "cat:math.LO",
  max_results = 3,
  sort_by = arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate
)

papers = []
for result in client.results(search):
  paper = {
    'title': result.title,
    'abstract': result.summary,
    'authors': [author.name for author in result.authors],
    'url': result.entry_id
  }
  papers.append(paper)

# Save the papers to a JSON file
with open('papers.json', 'w') as f:
  json.dump(papers, f)
```

This script should correctly create a JSON file named `papers.json` containing the information of the latest 3 LLM papers.

Engineer (to chat_manager):

Great, the script has successfully created a JSON file named `papers.json` containing the information of the latest 3 LLM papers. Now, let's write a script to convert this JSON file into a markdown file. The markdown file will contain the title, abstract, authors, and source URL of each paper.

```python
import json
import markdown

# Load the papers from the JSON file
with open('papers.json', 'r') as f:
  papers = json.load(f)

# Convert the papers to markdown
md = ''
for paper in papers:
  md += f"## {paper['title']}\n\n"
  md += f"**Authors:** {', '.join(paper['authors'])}\n\n"
  md += f"{paper['abstract']}\n\n"
  md += f"[Read more]({paper['url']})\n\n"

# Save the markdown to a file
with open('papers.md', 'w') as f:
  f.write(md)
```

This script will create a markdown file named `papers.md` containing the information of the latest 3 LLM papers.

Scientist (to chat_manager):

Great, the markdown file has been successfully created. Now, I will review the markdown file to ensure the information is accurate and complete. I will cross-check the information with the source URL. 

After reviewing, I will provide feedback to the engineer if any revisions are needed. If no revisions are needed, I will approve the final markdown file. The engineer can then submit the final markdown file to the admin for approval.
