# Prompts used to generate the app

Model: Claude-3.7-Sonnet

## Fetch the data

> Please create a script which downloads the fertility rate of each country in the world and puts it in a JSON file

```python fetch_fertility_rates.py```

and then it generated fertility_rates.json


## Clipboard
Assuming the data is in a JSON file, please create a React typescript app which displays an interactive map like @fertilityworldmap.png. No need to show the global fertility rate box.
The country name and fertility rate should be shown when mouse over. Please create a devlopment plan first, and cursor-rules before implementing anything
